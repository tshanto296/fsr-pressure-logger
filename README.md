# Tactile Logger ‚Äì FSR Pressure + LED Feedback

This project builds a tactile sensing and logging system using:
- A Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) to detect pressure
- An LED to respond in real time to high pressure
- A Python script to log readings and generate a graph

---

## üîß Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- FSR (Force Sensing Resistor)
- 220Œ© resistor
- LED
- Jumper wires + breadboard

---

## üß† What It Does
- Pressing on the FSR increases analog readings
- When pressure > threshold (800), LED turns on
- Python script logs readings in real time to CSV
- Auto-generates a line graph from your sensor data
